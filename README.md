## Introduction

The computer field has a wealth of electronic documentation for all knowledge, as well as standardized APIs. However, for traditional industries, such as civil engineering, most of the knowledge remains in paper documents, and the resources that exist in the network are often obscure and fragmented. In order to better enable future generations to understand the civil engineering industry, and to learn the corresponding knowledge, this open source project was created to collect the corresponding knowledge, and with the help of computer development knowledge, the corresponding knowledge will be interactive, AI-assisted Web form presented in the Internet. The knowledge is mainly based on China's civil engineering system built, welcome interested peers to contact, participate in the construction of the project
